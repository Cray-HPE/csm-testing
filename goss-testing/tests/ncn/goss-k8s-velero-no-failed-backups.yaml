        meta:
            desc: Validates there are no failed Velero backups. To cleanup backups that are known to have been interrupted, run the following to find the failed backup `kubectl get backups -A -o json | jq -e '.items[] | select(.status.phase | contains ("Failed")) | .metadata.name'`.  To then delete the backup, run `velero backup delete <backup> --confirm` (on a master or worker node).
