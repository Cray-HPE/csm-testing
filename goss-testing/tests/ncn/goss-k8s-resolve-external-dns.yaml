        title: Resolve external DNS
        meta:
            desc: |
                Validates that an external DNS name resolves.

                The test passes if LDAP is not configured or if LDAP is configured and the first configured LDAP server hostname can be resolved.
                The test fails in any of the following cases:

                * Unbound is not configured
                * The LDAP 'providerId' is configured but the LDAP 'connectionURL' is not.
                * The LDAP server hostname fails to resolve.

                In the case of failure, manually run {{$testscript}} on a Kubernetes NCN to see why the test failed.
                Refer to 'operations/network/dns/Troubleshoot_Common_DNS_Issues.md' in the CSM documentation to troubleshoot external DNS issues.
