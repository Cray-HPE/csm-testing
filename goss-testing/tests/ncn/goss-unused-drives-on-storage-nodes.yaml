                This test validates that the Ceph cluster contains the expected number of OSDs based on the hardware type and number of storage nodes.
                If the test fails, then see "install/troubleshooting_unused_drives_on_storage_nodes.md" in the CSM documentation for remediation steps.
                The test can be executed manually on any master NCN or the first three storage NCNs with the following command:
                "{{$check_for_unused_drives}}" "{{$num_storage_nodes}}" "{{$this_node_manufacturer}}"
            sev: 0
        exec: |-
