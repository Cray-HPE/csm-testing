# This suite is run:
# * During CSM installs before CSM services have been deployed,
# * During CSM Health Validation (after CSM services have been deployed),
#   only after PIT redeployment
#
# This suite should be run on an NCN master node.
#
# This suite is run as part of the ncn_kubernetes_checks script. This suite is
# only run locally on the NCN where the script is invoked (as opposed to
# tests in the ncn-kubernetes-test-master/worker suites, which are run
# on every master/worker node).
