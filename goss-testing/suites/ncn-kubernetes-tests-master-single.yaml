# This suite is run:
# * During CSM installs before CSM services have been deployed,
# * During CSM Health Validation (after CSM services have been deployed), both
#   before and after PIT redeployment
#

# During health validation, these tests are executed on a single master node
# in the cluster. Tests that are executed on every master node are in the
# corresponding suite file without the -single suffix.
