# The following files in this repository govern the Goss test variables:
#
# - goss-testing\vars\variables-common.yaml 
#       Definitions of variables that should have the same values when Goss tests are run on the LiveCD/PIT or on an NCN.
#
# - goss-testing\vars\variables-livecd.yaml 
#       Definitions of variables for Goss tests run on the LiveCD/PIT. These could be variables only needed for tests run on
#       the PIT, or these could be variables whose values need to be different when run on the PIT.
#
# - goss-testing\vars\variables-ncn.yaml 
#       Definitions of variables for Goss tests run on the NCNs. These could be variables only needed for tests run on
#       NCNs, or these could be variables whose values need to be different when run on NCNs.
#
# - csm-testing.spec
#       When installing the test RPM on a system, the variables-livecd.yaml and variables-ncn.yaml files that are installed on
#       the system are created by appending the livecd/ncn variable file from the repository to the common variable file from the repository.
#       The common variable file itself is not installed on the system.
#
#       NOTE: No intelligence is included in the merging of the common file with the livecd/ncn file -- if a variable is defined in both the common
#       file and the NCN or livecd file, then it will end up being defined twice in the final file.
#
# - goss-testing/automated/run-ncn-tests.sh
#       This shared Bash library contains a function which dynamically generates a variable file before Goss tests are run.
#       It starts with the livecd/ncn variable file that has been installed on the system, and appends to it some system-specific values (which are
#       determined when the function is called).
